  <h2>What is HyperText?</h2>
  <p>Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other
    text that the reader can immediately access. Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are
    typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch. Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also
    sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks.
    Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web, where Web pages are often written in the
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of
    information over the Internet.</p>

  <h2>What is a Node-Link Diagram?</h2>
  <p>
    A Node-Link Diagram is a type of diagram that is used to represent the relationships between different pieces of
    information. It is made up of nodes, which are the individual pieces of information, and links, which are the
    connections between the nodes. Node-Link Diagrams are used to visualize complex relationships between different
    pieces of information, and are often used in fields such as computer science, information science, and social
    sciences to
    represent complex systems and relationships.
