  <h1>Conclusion: </h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    HyperText has had a significant impact on the way that information is organized and accessed. The Web has revolutionized
    the way that information is published and accessed, and has made it possible to create and share information in a way
    that was never before possible. HyperText has also had a significant impact on the way that literature and art are
    created and consumed, and has given rise to new forms of creative expression that are based on the principles of
    non-linear information storage and retrieval.
