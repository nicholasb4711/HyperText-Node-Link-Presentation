  <h1>Understanding HyperText Components</h1>
  <h2>Hyperlinks: </h2>
  <p>
    Hyperlinks are the foundation of hypertext. They are the connections between different pieces of information that allow
    the reader to navigate between them. Hyperlinks are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch,
    and are used to connect different pieces of information in a non-linear way. Hyperlinks are one of the key underlying
    concepts of the World Wide Web, and are used to create interconnected documents that can be easily navigated and
    explored.
  </p>

  <h2>Nodes: </h2>
  <p>
    Nodes are the individual pieces of information that are connected by hyperlinks. They can be text, images, tables, or
    other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks. Nodes are the building blocks of hypertext, and are
    used to create interconnected documents that can be easily navigated and explored. Nodes are often used to represent
    different pieces of information, and are connected by hyperlinks to create a non-linear structure that allows for
    easy navigation and exploration.
  </p>

  <h2>Anchors: </h2>
  <p>
    Anchors are the points within a hypertext document that are linked to other points within the same document or to
    external documents. They are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch, and are used to
    create interconnected documents that can be easily navigated and explored. Anchors are often used to create
    non-linear structures within a hypertext document, and are connected by hyperlinks to create a non-linear structure
    that allows for easy navigation and exploration.
