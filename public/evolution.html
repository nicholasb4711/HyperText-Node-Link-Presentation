  <h1>Evolution of HyperText</h1>
  <h2>Origins: </h2>
  <p>HyperText was first conceived of by computer scientist Ted Nelson in the 1960s. Nelson envisioned a system of
    non-linear information storage and retrieval that would allow for the creation of a new type of literature. He called
    this system "Xanadu," and it was intended to be a way of organizing and linking information in a way that was not
    constrained by the linear structure of traditional books and documents. While Nelson's vision of Xanadu was never
    fully realized, his ideas were influential in the development of the World Wide Web, which is based on the principles
    of HyperText.
  </p>

  <h2>Evolution: </h2>
  <p>
    The concept of HyperText has evolved significantly since its inception. The World Wide Web, which was created by Tim
    Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, is based on the principles of HyperText and has revolutionized the way that
    information is organized and accessed. The Web has made it possible to publish and access information in a way that
    is not constrained by the limitations of traditional print media, and has enabled the easy dissemination of
    information to a global audience. The Web has also given rise to new forms of literature and art that are based on the
    principles of HyperText, such as hypertext fiction and interactive art installations.

  <h2>Impact: </h2>
  <p>
    The impact of HyperText on the way that information is organized and accessed cannot be overstated. The Web has
    revolutionized the way that information is published and accessed, and has made it possible to create and share
    information in a way that was never before possible. HyperText has also had a significant impact on the way that
    literature and art are created and consumed, and has given rise to new forms of creative expression that are based on
    the principles of non-linear information storage and retrieval.
