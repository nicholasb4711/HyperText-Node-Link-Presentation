  <h1>HyperText Today: Impact and Future Direction: </h1>

  <h2>Current Role: </h2>
  <p>
    HyperText is a fundamental concept in the field of computer science and information technology. It is the underlying
    principle of the World Wide Web, and is used to create interconnected documents that can be easily navigated and
    explored. HyperText is also used in fields such as knowledge management, information visualization, and data
    analysis to represent complex systems and relationships in an interactive and easy-to-understand way. The impact of HyperText on
    the way that information is organized and accessed cannot be overstated. The Web has revolutionized the way that
    information is published and accessed, and has made it possible to create and share information in a way that was never before
    possible. HyperText has also had a significant impact on the way that literature and art are created and consumed,
    and has given rise to new forms of creative expression that are based on the principles of non-linear information
    storage and retrieval.

  <h2>The Future: </h2>
  <p>
    The future of HyperText is bright, and it is likely to continue to play a significant role in the way that
    information is organized and accessed. As technology continues to evolve, new forms of HyperText are likely to emerge, and the
    principles of non-linear information storage and retrieval are likely to continue to influence the way that
    information is created and consumed. HyperText is also likely to continue to play a significant role in the field of data
    visualization, and is likely to be used to represent complex systems and relationships in an interactive and
    easy-to-understand way. The impact of HyperText on the way that information is organized and accessed cannot be
