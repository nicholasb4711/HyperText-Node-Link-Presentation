  <h1>HyperText in Action: Applications and HTML</h1>

  <h2>Applications of HyperText</h2>
  <p>
    HyperText has a wide range of applications, and is used in many different fields and industries. Some of the most common
    applications of HyperText include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web Browsing: The World Wide Web is based on the principles of HyperText, and is one of the most widely used
      applications of HyperText. The Web allows for the easy publication and access of information in a non-linear way, and
      has revolutionized the way that information is organized and accessed.</li>
      <br>
    <li>Interactive Fiction: HyperText has given rise to new forms of literature and art that are based on the principles of
      non-linear information storage and retrieval. Interactive fiction, for example, is a form of literature that allows the
      reader to make choices that affect the outcome of the story, and is made possible by the principles of HyperText.</li>
      <br>
    <li>Data Visualization: HyperText is often used in the field of data visualization to represent complex relationships
      between different pieces of information. Node-Link Diagrams, for example, are a type of diagram that is used to
      represent the relationships between different pieces of information, and are made up of nodes and links that are
      connected by hyperlinks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
  <p>
    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It is used to create the
    structure and content of a Web page, and is based on the principles of HyperText. HTML is made up of a series of
    elements, which are used to define the structure and content of a Web page. Each element is made up of a start tag, an
    end tag, and the content that is contained within the tags. For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element is used to
    define a top-level heading, and is made up of a start tag (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>), the content of the heading, and an
    end tag (<code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>).
  </p>

  <h2>Example: </h2>
  <p>
    <code>&lt;h1&gt;This is a top-level heading&lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;h2&gt;This is a second-level heading&lt;/h2&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;h3&gt;This is a third-level heading&lt;/h3&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com"&gt;This is a hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;</code><br>
    <code>&lt;img src="example.jpg" alt="This is an image"&gt;</code><br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element is used to define a top-level heading, the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
    element is used to define a second-level heading, and the <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element is used to define a
    third-level heading. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is used to define a paragraph of text, the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
    element is used to define a hyperlink, and the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is used to define an image.
